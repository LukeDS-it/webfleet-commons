# webfleet-commons

This project contains all utility classes that were starting to duplicate on the various
webfleet projects.

This repository is under the MIT license, so anyone can take inspiration or use this code freely,
be careful that it might not be suitable for what you need to do.

It is by no means a "framework", nor I intend to maintain this outside of the scope it was born
for: supporting the webfleet projects.
